/*
 * Since we already have a module interface due to us being in a plugin, it's pretty handy to just use it
 * to interact with the renderer. It gives us the added advantage of being able to decouple any render
 * hooks from game modules as well, allowing for safer and easier cleanup.
 *
 * With the advent of UE4.22 the renderer got an overhaul to more modern usage patterns present in API's
 * like DX12. The biggest differences for us are that we must now wrap all rendering code either in either
 * a "Render Graph" or a "Render Pass". They're good for different things of course.
 *
 * Render graphs:
 * In UE4, you generally want to work with graphs if you are working with larger rendering jobs and working with engine
 * pooled render targets. As the engine almost exclusively uses task graphs now for rendering tasks as well, learning
 * by example is also easier right now if you elect to use them. They are quite hard (if not impossible?) to use when
 * interfacing with UObject render resources like UTextures however, so if you want to do that, you need to use passes instead.
 * Graphs generally perform better if you use them for larger jobs. For smaller work, you yet again want to look at passes instead.
 *
 * Render passes:
 * Passes are very similar to the previous graphics API and are now used when using the rasterizer. 
 * Instead of setting the render target for a rasterization operation, you now set that up when beginning a render pass instead.
 * Operations that don't use the rasterizer (like compute, copy and other operations) simply use the RHICommandList directly like before.
 *
 * There are of course many resources you can leverage to get a better understanding of the new API. A good initial overview
 * can be found in this presentation:
 * See: https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/gameworks/blog/GDC16/GDC16_gthomas_adunn_Practical_DX12.pdf
